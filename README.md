Here I create a fluid , step form with React. A step form is a form broken down into steps. Here I create a step for "FirstName,LastName,Email", a second step for "Instrument,City,Bio", a third step for a chance for the user to review and confirm the date the put into the form. I use State and props to keep track of the step I was in(0-4). With functions like nextStep and prevStep I was able to add or take away form state.step. The value of Step determines what I Component I have UserForm return.
